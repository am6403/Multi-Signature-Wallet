# Multi-Signature-Wallet
A multi-signature wallet is a digital wallet designed to enhance security by requiring multiple private keys to authorize and execute transactions. Unlike traditional single-signature wallets that rely on a single key for access, multi-signature wallets distribute control among multiple parties. Common configurations include 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, where a specified number of private keys from the total set are required to validate a transaction. The added security layer ensures that a predetermined number of keys must match for a transaction to be successfully executed.
